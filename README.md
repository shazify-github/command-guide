# Commando Guide for Beginners

So I noticed there are very few resources to begin using the Commando command framework for Discord.js. Sure, there are a few tutorials out there, but they don't teach fundamental things such as args or how to properly use Commando's built-in `say`, `embed`, etc. That's what this guide is for. In this guide I will attempt to explain everything in commando from using args to when to use async for your commands. It's the least I can do for the people at Discord.js who helped me greatly on learning how to use it.

#### Before You Begin

Before you start with this guide I recommend you take a look at the official Discord.js guide. It'll teach you the fundamentals for Discord.js, which you can use to aid you in understanding this guide. Please note that I'm going to assume you have read that guide before this one. You can find that guide [here](http://discordjs.guide/).

#### More Information

Should you need more help after using this guide be sure to the Discord.js Official Server, where a Commando channel is available for all your questions. You can join that server with [this link](https://discord.gg/bRCvFy9).
